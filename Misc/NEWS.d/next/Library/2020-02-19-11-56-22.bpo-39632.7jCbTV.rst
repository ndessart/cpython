Fix and improve ctypes variadic function support. Functions that take a
variable number of arguments should now be declared using an Ellipsis (...)
as their last argument (just as a prototype for a C function).  ctypes variadic
functions declared this way automatically perform the default argument
promotion (small integer types are promoted to c_int and c_float is promoted to
double).
